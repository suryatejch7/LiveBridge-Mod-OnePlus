# LiveBridge

LiveBridge is a Flutter Android app with native Kotlin logic that converts regular notifications into Android Live Updates (Live Activity-like UX on Android 16+)

## Core features

- Converts progress notifications into Live Updates
- Smart status detection (taxi, delivery, food order flows)
- OTP code extraction from notifications
- App filtering modes
- Per-app presentation overrides

## Small features you'll love

- Haptic feedback
- Predictive back gesture
- Edge-to-edge layout without app bars
- Customizable parsing dictionaries

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK 3.9+
- Android SDK configured to compile and target Android 16
- Android 16+ device

## Quick Start

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Build

Debug APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

Release APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## Permissions and Device Setup

For stable behavior, the app usually needs:

- Notification Listener access
- Notification permission for LiveBridge itself
- Live Updates permission (where required by system/vendor)
- Background activity/battery exclusion on some OEM ROMs

## Known Issues

- On AOSP, app icon and label behavior may differ from OEM firmware
- AoD and `isOngoing` behavior vary across OEM vendors

## Notes

- Feel free to open issues or pull requests. LiveBridge is under active development
- Testing on multiple OEMs is highly recommended
