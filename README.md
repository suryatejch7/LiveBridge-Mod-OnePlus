## Quick Start

Developer setup:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Build

Debug APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

Release APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## Permissions and Device Setup

For stable behavior, the app usually needs:

- Notification Listener access
- Notification permission for LiveBridge itself
- Live Updates permission (where required by system/vendor)
- Background activity/battery exclusion on some OEM ROMs

## Known Issues

- On AOSP, app icon and label behavior may differ from OEM firmware
- AoD and `isOngoing` behavior vary across OEM vendors

- NOT WORKING on Chinese OriginOS
- NOT WORKING on CMF devices
- Working badly on Nothing devices without Progress Glyph indicators

## Notes

- Feel free to open issues or pull requests. LiveBridge is under active development
- Testing on multiple OEMs is highly recommended
